#Intro to using Git, Python, and Leaflet
This talk is an introduction to some popular tools for doing GIS-related 
development: Git (version control), Python (programming) and Leaflet 
(a web mapping library). Even if you're not a developer, these tools 
are very accessible and it never hurts to add some new tools to your toolbelt. 
After a brief introduction to Git, Python, and Leaflet, we'll put them all to 
use by building a simple web mapping application. This will be an interactive 
tutorial, so bringing your laptop and following along is encouraged, but not 
required. If you want to follow along, please follow the instructions below 
to install Git and Python for your operating system. We'll spend a few minutes 
during the talk on this, but time is limited so it would be awesome if you 
come ready to go!
